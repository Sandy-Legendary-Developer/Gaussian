# Gaussian Elimination

## AIM:
To write a program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Read the order of matrix and its augmented form.
2. Apply forward elimination to form an upper triangular matrix.
3. Perform back substitution to compute unknowns.
4. Print the solution of all variables.


## Program:

## Output:
![gaussian elimination](./output.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the solution of a matrix using Gaussian Elimination is written and verified using python programming.
